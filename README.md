# Debt Excel Analysis

Simple Excel dashboards with dedicated graphs for each city/state.

What this repo contains
- Excel workbook(s) built with Power Pivot (Data Model).
- Dedicated chart sheets: one sheet (or chart) per city/state so you can review each area separately.
- Sample or exported data (if included) and any helper notes.

How to open & use
1. Open the workbook in Microsoft Excel (Excel 2016 or later recommended).
2. If prompted, enable data connections and content.
3. If the workbook contains macros, enable macros only if you trust the file.
4. Refresh the model: Data → Refresh All to update Power Pivot and charts.
5. Navigate to the city/state sheets to view the dedicated graphs.

Notes
- Workbooks use Power Pivot for aggregation — refresh the Data Model to update visuals.
- Avoid committing sensitive or personally identifiable data. Use anonymized sample data if needed.
